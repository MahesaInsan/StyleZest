Final project for “Software Engineering” course, where we were instructed to create a software that has its own business value and how to sell it. My team created a website platform called StyleZest which can be used for small businesses to expand their sales. This platform are intended for clothing businesses as the template for their business are already prepared by our platform. The clothes, size, category, color and gender can be change according to the seller needs also, the seller can change the website appearance to give a uniqueness and differentiate each seller from each other even though they are using the same platform.
